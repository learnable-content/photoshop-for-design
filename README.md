# Introduction

Though I have a modern PC, Photoshop still crashes from time to time. Most of the issues happen when updating drivers, for example, for the video card. In an ideal world, your computer would be rock solid, but as we know,that's not the case. So we need to adapt, and that means we need to save often.

# Organizing and saving projects in hard drive

Here's what I recommend:

* Have your 960 grid file on you desktop since you'll use it non-stop.
* Have a folder named *photoshop_project* son your hard drive and create a shortcut to that folder on your desktop.
* As you start up a new project, open up the 960 grid file, add any element to it, and then immediately go to the File menu, and press Save As. Don't use Save because you'll overwrite your 960 grid file and the next time you want to use it, you can't, since it will have all the layers you made for another project.
* Save your progress in the *photoshop_projects* folder on your hard drive.
* Hit `Ctrl+S` every few minutes, even though CS6 has an auto-save function every five minutes.

# Preview PSD's inside the projects folder

You'll realize as the projects stack up in your folder, you might want to reuse elements from the past. Here is a very fast and efficient way to preview your PSDs:

* Add an image to your project folders.
* Rename it as *1.jpg*.
* Install ACDSee. It is a very popular image viewer, and it has a free version.
* Then, when you want to preview your projects, just open *1.jpg*, and use your arrows to browse through. 

This is dead simple, doesn't require a lot of sources and it's very fast.

# Managing resource files

Another thing I recommend is to create another folder inside *photoshop_projects* named *resources* or something like that. Here you should stockpile all sorts of stock photos, icon sets, textures, and so forth. When you need something, you can just look through this folder instead of browsing on the web.

# Hosting files in cloud storage

One last thing I would recommend as you progress in your web design is to invest in a **cloud storage system**. I use Google Drive for example. What this does is it uploads your files to the Internet and keeps them safe in case your hard drive dies for example. It's also nice if you're working from the different computers.

Imagine if I were to lose 500 PSDs and tens of gigabytes of resources I've collected over the years. What would be the financial lose of that? So I pay $10 every month for this service and I strongly recommend it as you go along.
