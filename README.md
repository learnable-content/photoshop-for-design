# Introduction

Stock images already look pretty good since they're usually adjusted and balanced, but sometimes you might use pictures from a free website like [sxc.hu](http://sxc.hu). And if that's the case, those look pretty bland.

# Working saturation of images

A simple, yet efficient solution, is to increase the saturation of the image. Bright, vivid pictures always look better.

* Add an adjustment layer and select Hue and Saturation.
* Raise the saturation to about 10% or 20% - it really depends on the image.
