# Introduction

We are going to use Photoshop tools in real life situations. I don't expect you to know all these tools by heart at this point, but we're going to practice constantly, until you get used to all these techniques. From now on, we're going to use a special *.psd* file which will help us create every single website design.

# 960 Grid system

You may get the special *.psd* file in three easy steps:

* Go to [960.gs](http://960.gs) and hit the Download button.
* Extract the files from the downloaded archive.
* Go into *templates/photoshop/960_grid_24_col.psd* and use that.

A slightly modified version of this file can be found at the *resources* folder inside the accompanying archive, and actually I recommend you working with that one.

I also wanted to note that every designer works differently, given that Photoshop allows multiple ways of achieving the same result. So use whatever technique suits you!
