# Aligning elements in exercise

Here is the solution to the exercise:

* Select all of the objects from the layers panel.
* Go to the top panel and click Align Bottom Edges and then Distribute Horizontal Centers.
* Elements are a bit bunched up, so move one of the extremes more to the left or right side.
* Use the Distribute Horizontal Centers again - elements will become more spaced out.
* Deselect elements (`Ctrl+D`).
* Hold `Shift` (to make your objects move only in straight lines), then start arranging them by color. Remember to always use `Shift` or `Ctrl` to quickly select or deselect one or more objects.
* Now arrange elements by height. Select them all and space them out, again, if needed.
* To center them on the screen, hit `Ctrl+G`, then `Ctrl+A`, use Align Horizontal Centers.
* Press `Ctrl+D` to deselect.

# Grouping elements into folders

Now group elements by color.

* Select them one by one using `Ctrl+click` then press `Ctrl+Shift+click`.
* Hit `Ctrl+G`.
* Double click on the name to rename the folder.

# Saving the exercise files

* Select all the folders and move them out of the initial folder.
* Delete the initial folder.
* Go to File > Save As, name it "solved-layers-folders".

You'll probably be slow at first, but do this a couple of times, and you'll get the hang of it.
