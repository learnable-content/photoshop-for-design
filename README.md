# Introduction

The first step you need to master is moving around within a project. To do this well, you must completely understand and apply a few things I consider best practices.

# Best practices for using Photoshop

* Always keep one hand on your keyboard and one on your mouse. Never let a hand set idle, because this means you won't be able to use hotkeys.
* I recommend you keep your feet flat on the floor, work at a desk and keep both hands on your peripherals. This applies even if you have a laptop, so please don't work in your bed or while lounging on the couch.
* Always know on which layer you're on. If you don't know where you're at, just take a look at the Layers panel. The active layer is always highlighted. Also, if you want to select a layer, do it from the canvas with a `Ctrl+click`, so you're keeping your focus on the task at hand, and not scrolling through tens of layers in the Layers panel.
* Always use your hotkeys. If you want to go undo an action, don't use the menu up top, instead use `Ctrl+Z`.
* Always go back to the Move tool by pressing `V`. Since you're constantly arranging things on the canvas, this is the best habit you can possibly have. Whether it's text, a shape, or a graphical element, you'll surely need to either move it, align it in some way, center it, re-position it etc. 
* Always group your layers, and rename them. Every few minutes or so, I take a few seconds to double-click on a layer's name and rename it. Use `Ctrl` to select multiple layers, and then group them by using `Ctrl+G`.
