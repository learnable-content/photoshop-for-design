# Introduction to black and white photos

I will show you a very simple, but still useful technique. 

* Open up an image in Photoshop.
* Go to the Adjustments icon at the bottom.
* Select Black and White.

One thing to note is if you have this area selected, which is called the mask, your colors from the left side change to black and white.

To understand why, grab a brush and start painting. Black adds color, white removes it. This way, you can easily make certain areas stand out.

Black and white images usually show that the element is not active or selected. This is great when creating thumbnails, for example, so keep this in mind when you want to give your design a bit of an edge.
