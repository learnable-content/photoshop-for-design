# Introduction

Open up the styles box by going to Window > Styles. The idea is you create the shape of a button, then use a predefined style that automatically adds all sorts of effects. This obviously saves you time because you don't have to select your own gradient, adjust the bevel, the satin levels, etc. So I don't recommend you download too many from the internet. 

# Saving layer styles

One thing to note is, if you design an amazing blue button, what you can do is save that and reuse it. To save a style:

* Click once on the Styles panel.
* Choose a name.

Again, don't use this option too much as it takes away from your creativity. Instead of creating a button that fits your design, you wind up wasting time by looking for one that looks decent and somewhat fits.
