# Removing background of stock images

Often you'll have to use stock photos in *.jpg* format. This means that they will have a white background, and although you can remove it, it's sometimes difficult and time consuming to do. Here is a simple way to go this:

* Select the image.
* Go up top and change the normal blending mode to multiply.

The image will look good without any white background. You can also try darkening as an alternative. This is great for certain colors but usually only for light backgrounds.
