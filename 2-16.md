# Introduction

Besides the Move tool, the Marquee tool is something you'll constantly use.

# Taking measurements with Marquee tool

First of all, in CS6, you can use this tool to make measurements.

* Press `M` to select the rectangular Marquee.
* Click and drag. You'll see some measurements will appear that represent the width and height of your selection.

This is great because symmetry is extremely important in web design and you don't have to constantly switch to the Ruler tool.

# Erase and replace text with Marquee tool

Let's say a client asked you to improve font on his current website, and especially in the call to action buttons. Instead of recreating those buttons, which is hard enough if they have some fine details to them, you can use the Marquee tool to erase the text and type another in its place.

* Make a print screen by pressing the `PrintScreen` button on your keyboard.
* Create a new project file in Photoshop by pressing `Ctrl+N`.
* Press `Ctrl+V` to paste your screenshot and zoom in on the button.
* Get the rectangular Marquee tool and make a small selection as tall as the text
* Press `Ctrl+T` and drag the handle - the font will disappear.

The other fast way you should know is to select the text with the Marquee tool, press `Shift+F5` and select Content Aware. This does almost the same thing.

Going back to the Marquee tool in our print screen layer, you can also make a selection of that button, then press `Ctrl+J` to make a copy of it. Now if you move it, you'll see your button will be on a new layer.

# Increase size of elements with Marquee tool

This is also good when you want to increase the size of an element that's not created by you. Suppose there is an already created table and you want to make it wider.

* Use the Marquee tool to select the edge.
* Move it outwards, then make a selection on the interior.
* Press `Ctrl+T`, and drag it.

Results will vary depending on your image.
