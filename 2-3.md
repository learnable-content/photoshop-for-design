# Exercise

Open the *layers-folders.psd* file from the accompanying archive before proceeding. Your task is to arrange the shapes from the shortest to the tallest, group them into folders by their color, and have them all sitting on the same base, and having the same distance between them.

The *solved-layers-folders.jpg* file contains an image of how your project should look at the end. Use that as a guide. In the next step I will show you how to solve this exercise.
