# Introduction

Sometime you don't get logos in the proper format, and you'll be forced to either remove the white background, or change the blending mode to multiply. If you choose the latter, you'll notice that the logo seems darker and doesn't stand out as it should. A simple way to fix this is to create a small highlight behind it.

# Highlighting a logo

* Select the brush tool, and create a new layer that we'll position behind the logo layer.
* Adjust the brush size, so it will create a highlight a bit bigger than the logo.
* Set hardness to 0%, so it will create a very soft highlight.
* Click on the canvas and your logo stands out a bit more.
