# Introduction to alignment tools

The **alignment tools** on the top panel work differently based on what you have selected. These tools need two elements to compare their positioning to each other.

# Align two elements on screen

If you have two objects and you have them both selected, of course they will aligned according to their positions. All the tools move one object in conjunction with the other.

But what about when you want to center two objects on the screen? If you just select them, and hit Align Horizontal Centers, they will just center themselves. This is because you didn't give Photoshop the proper command. What you need to say is, "I want to take these two objects and put them in the center of the screen".

To do that:

* Group the two objects into a folder - that will become our first element.
* Select the entire screen as the second element (use `Ctrl+A`).
* Press Align Horizontal Centers.

# Align three elements on screen

If we have three items selected, we'll have additional alignment tools up top.

Distribute Horizontal Centers and Distribute Vertical Centers are the tools you'll most likely use in web design. For example, to align objects in the horizontal center of the screen:

* Group the objects.
* Select the group.
* Use Distribute Horizontal Centers.

You need to practice these concepts so you know how to move and align objects with precision in a fast and efficient way. This is probably the most important thing you need to master at this moment, so in the next step I've prepared an exercise file for you.
