# Introduction to sliders

A **slider** is usually the main gallery component of a website that occupies the top central area. It's also known as the **hero area** since it's usually the most important, but it can also be called the main banner or slide show area. The purpose of the slider is to create a high impact and long lasting impression. Usually it contains some call to action, for example, a certain discount on a product.

# Designing a slider

* Get the Round Rectangle Tool and draw a shape as wide as the website.
* Add a light grey stroke to it and maybe a gradient of some sort that will make your text stand out.
* Press `T` and write the headline (the text should be fairly big and probably bold).
* Add a drop shadow, but make sure you use a color that's a bit darker than the background - black is usually too powerful.

* Create a second line of text, which will have two to three lines of the offer description. You may visit [lipsum.com](http://lipsum.com) to get some filler text. The font size should be smaller than the headline, but still decently big (about 16-20px).
* Go to [iconfinder.com](http://iconfinder.com) and select an icon that's big enough to use. Download and grag it into place.

# Adding slider controls

Slider will obviously have multiple images so we need some controlling element to scroll back and forth.

* Drag a black rectangle.
* From the Custom Shape select an arrow and set it to white.
* Adjust the size if needed with `Ctrl+T`, put it in place and make sure the arrow is centered inside the rectangle.
* Group, duplicate, `Ctrl+T` and flip horizontally.

# Designing a loading image

Usually slides don't load instantly, so let's have an icon that represents that. Go to [iconfinder.com](http://iconfinder.com) and search for a suitable icon. It is better to have the icon in white for better visibility, so go to the Effects > Color Overlay and use white.

# Designing a navigation icons

Let's add some final elements to the slider.

* Draw a black rectangle at the bottom of the slider.
* Select the round rectangle tool, set the radius to 5 pixels and draw a shape.

* Select the Ellipse tool and make a few circles.
* Make them all be white, except one, which should be blue to represent that it is the active one.
* Rename and group the layers.

# Designing a 3D shadow

* Make a rectangle.
* Use the Gaussian blur effect and lower the opacity
* Move the layer underneath the slider.
* Hit `Ctrl+T` and select Perspective.
* Drag while holding `Shift` and you'll see this gives the slider a 3D aspect.
